title: 'Security-relevant software updates to PostgreSQL must be installed'

description: |-
    Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

rationale: |-
    Use of versions of an application which are not supported by the vendor
    are not permitted. Vendors respond to security flaws with updates and
    patches. These updates are not available for unsupported version which
    can leave the application vulnerable to attack.

ocil_clause: 'it is not updated'

ocil: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or
    a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will
    indicate if updates are available:
    <pre>$ sudo yum check-update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources,
    run the following command to list when each package was last updated:
    <pre>$ rpm -qa -last</pre>
    Compare this to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) listed at
    {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/active/") }}}
    to determine if the system is missing applicable updates.
